# Bixal Style Dictionary Prototype

## What's Included

All of the style properties and assets are in this package. Make any changes to suit your needs. This package has CSS, SCSS, JS ES6 and Module code, as well as Base64 assets.

To get started, run
```
$ npm install
$ npm run build
or
$ npm run watch
```

The npm build task is what performs the style dictionary build steps to generate the files for each platform. Every time you change something in the style dictionary, like changing colors or adding properties, you will have to run this command again to generate the files.
